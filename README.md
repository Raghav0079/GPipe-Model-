# GPipe-Model-
# 🚀 GPipe + AmoebaNet on CIFAR-10  

This project demonstrates **scalable neural network training** using **GPipe pipeline parallelism** with **AmoebaNet-Small** and **Transformer-based** architectures on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**.  

The implementation is lightweight enough to run on **Google Colab Free/Pro**, but also supports **W&B tracking**, **Gradio UI**, and **Hugging Face Hub deployment** for real-world usage.

---

## 🚦 Usage

Train a model:
```bash
python gpipe_amoebanet.py --config config.yaml
```

Or use the Colab notebook for step-by-step training:
[Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TRTdU60KI_2SZmL8dHcwUSaf2o_2-T96#scrollTo=NsY8fBeAovgk)

---

## 📊 Experiment Tracking

Integrates [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/) for logging. Set your W&B API key to enable experiment tracking.

---

## 🎛️ Gradio Demo

Run the interactive demo:
```bash
python gradio_app.py
```
Or deploy on Hugging Face Spaces.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

Push trained models to [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/) and deploy Gradio Spaces for live inference.

## 📈 Results

| Model            | Accuracy | Hardware      |
|------------------|----------|--------------|
| AmoebaNet-Small  | 94%      | Colab T4 GPU |
| Transformer      | 92%      | Colab T4 GPU |

---

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Support for larger datasets (ImageNet)
- More NAS architectures
- Multi-GPU optimization
- Enhanced Gradio UI features
